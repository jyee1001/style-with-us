  <p align="center">
    The problem that our project, a virtual online wardrobe, addresses is the challenge of managing a large and diverse collection of clothing items in an efficient and organized manner. Many people struggle with keeping track of their clothing, especially when their collection grows over time. This can lead to frustration, cluttered wardrobes, and wasted time trying to find the right outfit for a specific occasion.
